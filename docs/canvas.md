# Canvases

The `copper-cloud-canvas` crate (`crates/canvas`) serves collaborative whiteboards: a REST
API for canvases, members and invites, and one live Yjs room per open canvas that speaks the
standard `y-websocket` protocol. The wire protocol, document schema and ops/read JSON are in
[canvas-protocol.md](canvas-protocol.md).

Everything here is mounted under `/v1`, behind the instance-key gate
(`X-Copper-Instance`) and session auth (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `?token=`), like
the rest of the [API](api.md). Errors use the common `{"error","message"}` shape.

## Model

| Table | What |
|---|---|
| `canvases` | `id`, `owner_id`, `name`, `kind` (`personal`/`shared`), `doc_key_wrapped`, timestamps |
| `canvas_members` | `(canvas_id, user_id)`, `role` (`owner`/`editor`), `added_at` — the owner has a row too |
| `canvas_invites` | email invites: `email` (lower-cased), `invited_by`, `status` (`pending`/`accepted`/`declined`/`revoked`), `nudged_at` (last re-send reminder), `token` (hash, reserved) |
| `canvas_share_links` | opaque share-link token digest, `role` (`editor`), `created_by`, `uses`; tokens are never persisted in plaintext |
| `canvas_updates` | append-only Yjs update log: `seq bigserial`, `canvas_id`, `"update"` (sealed) |
| `canvas_snapshots` | one compacted state per canvas: `seq` (last update folded in), `state` (sealed) |
| `canvas_mentions` | chat @mentions: `canvas_id`, `message_id` (the client's chat message id), `from_user`, `to_user`, `excerpt_sealed`, `created_at`, `read_at`; one row per `(canvas_id, message_id, to_user)` |

Migrations: `crates/copper-cloud/migrations/0100_canvases.sql`,
`0101_canvas_share_links.sql`, `0102_canvas_invite_nudge.sql` and `0103_canvas_mentions.sql`
(the canvas crate owns `0100`–`0199`).

- **Personal canvas**: every user has exactly one (`kind = personal`, name `Personal`),
  created on first use (`GET /canvases`, or any `/canvases/personal/...` route) — a unique
  partial index on `owner_id WHERE kind = 'personal'` makes concurrent first use safe. It can
  never be renamed, deleted, shared or left (`400`).
- **Roles**: `owner` (rename, delete, remove members) and `editor` (read/write the document,
  invite others, leave). Both can edit the board.
- **Access is membership**: every lookup joins `canvas_members` on the caller. A canvas you
  are not a member of — or that does not exist — is `404` on every route (no existence leak).
  A member who lacks the role for an action gets `403`.

`{id}` in every route below is a canvas UUID **or the literal `personal`**.

## REST

### `GET /canvases`

Your canvases, Personal first, then most recently updated.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "0192…", "name": "Personal", "kind": "personal", "role": "owner",
    "owner": { "id": "0192…", "email": "ann@example.com", "display_name": "Ann" },
    "member_count": 1,
    "created_at": "2026-10-01T12:00:00Z", "updated_at": "2026-10-01T12:05:00Z"
  }
]
```

`updated_at` follows document activity (bumped at most every 2 s while a room is busy).

### `POST /canvases {name}` → `201` canvas

Creates a `shared` canvas owned by you (owner member row included). `name` is trimmed,
control characters dropped, 1–200 characters. The document starts with `meta.name` and
`meta.createdBy`.

### `GET /canvases/{id}` → canvas · `PATCH /canvases/{id} {name}` → canvas · `DELETE /canvases/{id}` → `{"ok":true}`

Rename and delete are owner-only (`403` for editors) and `400` on the Personal canvas.
Rename also updates the document's `meta.name` (synced to connected peers). Delete removes
the canvas, members, invites, updates and snapshot (cascade) and closes its room: connected
sockets get close code `4404`.

### `GET /canvases/{id}/members`

```json
[{ "user_id": "…", "email": "…", "display_name": "…", "role": "owner", "added_at": "…" }]
```

Owner first, then by join time. Any member may list.

### `DELETE /canvases/{id}/members/{user_id}` → `{"ok":true}`

The owner removes anyone else; any member removes themselves (leave). The owner cannot leave
(`400` — delete the canvas instead). Removed users' open sockets close with `4403`.

### `POST /canvases/{id}/invites {email}` → `201` new invite · `200` already pending (re-send)

Owner or editor. The email is trimmed and lower-cased; inviting yourself is `400`, an
existing member `409`, the Personal canvas `400`. An email with no account yet is fine: the
invite waits until someone signs up with it. Even when the email already belongs to a user,
they must accept — nobody is added to a canvas without consent.

- **New invite → `201`.** The invitee (if they have an account) gets a `canvas` event with
  kind `invited`.
- **Already pending → `200`** with the same invite, and the call is a **re-send**: if the
  invitee has an account and the last reminder (`nudged_at`, else `created_at`) is at least
  30 s old, `nudged_at` is set to now and the invitee gets another `invited` event — clients
  use it to surface the invite again. Re-sends inside the 30 s window, or to an email with no
  account yet, change nothing.

The response is the invite view plus `nudged`: `true` only when this call reminded the
invitee (a `200` re-send that was not throttled); `false` on `201` and when throttled or
there is no account yet.

```json
{
  "id": "…", "canvas_id": "…", "canvas_name": "Roadmap", "email": "bob@example.com",
  "status": "pending",
  "invited_by": { "id": "…", "email": "ann@example.com", "display_name": "Ann" },
  "invitee": { "id": "…", "email": "bob@example.com", "display_name": "Bob" },
  "created_at": "…",
  "nudged_at": "…",
  "nudged": true
}
```

Invite views (here and in both lists below) carry:

- `invitee` — the account with that email, or `null` while nobody has signed up with it
  (e.g. "waiting for them to make an account");
- `nudged_at` — RFC 3339 time of the last re-send reminder, `null` until the first one.

Both fields (and `nudged`) are new in 0.5.0; older clients ignore them.

### `GET /canvases/{id}/invites`

Pending invites of a canvas (any member), newest first.

### `DELETE /canvases/{id}/invites/{invite_id}` → `204`

Revoke a pending invite (0.5.0). Allowed for the canvas owner and for the member who sent
it; any other member gets `403 {"error":"forbidden"}`. An unknown invite, one of another
canvas, or one that is no longer pending (accepted, declined, already revoked) is
`404 {"error":"not_found"}`; non-members get `404` as everywhere. The invite's status becomes
`revoked`: it disappears from both lists, can no longer be accepted or declined (`404`), and
the email can be invited again (a new `201`). The invitee (if they have an account) gets a
`canvas` event with kind `invite_revoked`.

### `GET /invites`

Pending invites addressed to **your** email (case-insensitive), with canvas name and inviter,
newest first.

### `POST /invites/{id}/accept` → canvas (your view, `role: editor`) · `POST /invites/{id}/decline` → `{"ok":true}`

Only the invitee can accept or decline; anything else (wrong user, already used, declined,
revoked, unknown) is `404`. Invites are single-use.

### Canvas share links

`POST /canvases/{id}/links` is available to any member. The body may be `{}` or
`{"role":"editor"}`; `owner` and other roles are rejected with `400`. It returns `201` and the
one-time-visible token:

```json
{"id":"uuid","token":"<43 chars>","canvas_id":"uuid","role":"editor","created_at":"…"}
```

Owners can list links with `GET /canvases/{id}/links`:

```json
{"links":[{"id":"uuid","role":"editor","created_by":"uuid","created_at":"…","uses":3}]}
```

Tokens are omitted from lists. Owners revoke one (`DELETE .../links/{link_id}`) or every link
(`DELETE .../links`); both return `204`. A missing link on these owner-scoped routes is `404`.

A signed-in user can preview `GET /canvas-links/{token}` without being a member:
`{"canvas_id","name","owner":{"id","display_name"},"role","member"}`. Unknown,
revoked, or deleted-canvas tokens return `404` with `error: "link_not_found"`.

`POST /canvas-links/{token}/join` is safe to retry. It adds an editor membership when needed,
never downgrades an existing owner, accepts/removes a pending email invite for the caller,
increments the link's `uses`, publishes the normal `member_added` canvas event, and returns the
same canvas object as one item from `GET /canvases`.

Share links are unavailable for Personal canvases. They never expire on their own; deleting a
canvas cascades its links.

### `GET /canvases/{id}/state[?sv=<base64>]`

`{"state": "<base64 of encode_state_as_update_v1>"}` — the whole document as one Yjs update
(standard base64, padded). With `sv` (a base64 lib0-v1 state vector) only what that state
vector is missing is returned. Apply with `Y.applyUpdate(doc, bytes)`.

### `GET /canvases/{id}/read[?full=true&ids=a,b&types=sticky,text]`

The agent-friendly read format (see [canvas-protocol.md](canvas-protocol.md#read)), identical
to the page's `copperCanvas.read`. Text is cut to 500 characters unless `full=true`. Since
0.6.0 it also carries `chat`: the last 50 messages of the canvas chat, oldest first (see
[Chat and mentions](#chat-and-mentions)); `ids` / `types` narrow the shapes, not the chat.

### `GET /people`

Any signed-in user may list active accounts on this instance (excluding themselves):
`{"people":[{"id","display_name","email"}]}`. `q` is a case-insensitive substring filter
on display name or email; results are sorted by display name. `limit` defaults to 20 and is
capped at 50. This is an intentional team-server directory surface; it is not restricted to
canvas members.

### `POST /canvases/{id}/ops`

```json
{ "ops": [ { "op": "add", "shape": { "type": "sticky", "text": "Hello" } } ],
  "as": { "name": "Planner", "color": "purple" },
  "near": { "x": 0, "y": 0 },
  "confirm": false }
```

Applies [canvas ops](canvas-protocol.md#ops) to the live document in one transaction, then
persists and broadcasts the change exactly like a WebSocket update — connected clients see
it immediately. Returns `{"applied": n, "ids": [...], "errors": [...]}` (`ids[i]` belongs to
op `i`, `null` when it failed). Lets remote agents draw without a client.

- `as` (optional): who is drawing. Shapes created get `by = as.name`; without `as`, `by` is
  your display name (or email). With `as`, the agent's entry in the `agents` map is set to
  `writing` with its cursor on the last thing touched, then back to `idle` 1.5 s later.
- `near`: where auto-placement looks for free space (default `0,0`).
- `confirm: true` is required for `{op:"clear"}` (or put `confirm: true` on the op).
- At most 500 ops per call; the body may be a bare array of ops too. Envelope problems
  (`ops` not an array, bad `as`, too many ops) are reported like the page does: `200` with
  `errors: [{"index": -1, …}]`. Malformed JSON is `400`.

### Chat and mentions

Shared canvases have a chat (0.6.0). The messages live **in the canvas document** — a
top-level `Y.Array` named `chat` of plain objects
`{id, authorId, authorName, text, mentions: [userId], at, editedAt?, deleted?}` (see
[canvas-protocol.md](canvas-protocol.md#document-schema)) — written by Copper and synced,
persisted, compacted and reloaded by the room like every other part of the document. The
server never writes it; `GET /canvases/{id}/read` shows the most recent 50. What the server
adds is **mention notifications**: after Copper inserts a message that @mentions people, it
reports them, and the server records one row per recipient and tells them.

#### `POST /canvases/{id}/mentions {message_id, user_ids, excerpt}` → `200`

```json
{ "message_id": "msg_01J…", "user_ids": ["0192…ben", "0192…cy"], "excerpt": "@Ben @Cy dinner Tuesday?" }
```

Any member. `user_ids` is filtered to **current members of the canvas other than the
caller**; each such recipient gets a stored mention and a `canvas` event with kind `mention`.
Idempotent per `(canvas, message_id, recipient)`: repeating the call (a retry) answers the
same and notifies nobody again; the first excerpt wins.

```json
{ "notified": ["0192…ben", "0192…cy"], "skipped": ["0192…left-the-canvas"] }
```

- `notified`: the requested users that are mentioned by this message (members other than you),
  including on a retry; `skipped`: everyone else (yourself, non-members, unknown ids), in
  request order, duplicates removed.
- `message_id`: 1–128 characters, no control characters (`400`). `user_ids`: UUIDs, at most
  100 (`400`); may be empty. `excerpt`: optional; control characters and runs of whitespace
  become one space, then it is cut to 200 characters. It is sealed at rest under the canvas
  doc key.
- Non-members and unknown canvases: `404` (as everywhere). The Personal canvas has no chat:
  `400`. More than 60 calls per minute per user (bursts of 60, then one per second): `429
  {"error":"rate_limited"}`.

#### `GET /mentions[?unread=1&limit=n]`

Your mentions on canvases you are still a member of, newest first. `unread=1` (or `true`)
returns only unread ones; `limit` defaults to 50 and is capped at 100 (`< 1` is `400`).
`unread` (in the body) counts every unread mention you can see, regardless of `limit`.

```json
{
  "mentions": [
    {
      "id": "0192…",
      "canvas": { "id": "0192…", "name": "Team dinners" },
      "from": { "id": "0192…", "display_name": "Ann", "email": "ann@example.com" },
      "message_id": "msg_01J…",
      "excerpt": "@Ben @Cy dinner Tuesday?",
      "created_at": "2026-10-06T18:00:00Z",
      "read_at": null
    }
  ],
  "unread": 1
}
```

Leaving a canvas hides its mentions (they come back if you rejoin); deleting a canvas or
either account deletes them.

#### `POST /mentions/read {ids} | {canvas_id}` → `{"ok": true, "updated": n}`

Marks your own unread mentions read — by mention `id` (at most 500) and/or every mention on
`canvas_id`. Others' mentions and canvases you are not a member of are silently untouched
(`updated` counts what changed). For each canvas where something changed you get a `canvas`
event with kind `mention_read`, so your other devices clear their badges. Neither key → `400`.

Clients gate this on `GET /v1/info` `version >= 0.6.0`; on older servers the chat still works
(it is part of the document) but there are no mention notifications.

### `GET /canvases/{id}/ws` — live room

WebSocket upgrade (HTTP/1.1 `GET`, or HTTP/2 extended `CONNECT`). Auth: the `Authorization`
header, or `?token=` for tools that cannot set headers; the `X-Copper-Instance` header is
still required. Non-members get `404` before the upgrade. Protocol details:
[canvas-protocol.md](canvas-protocol.md#wire-protocol).

Example URL: `wss://HOST:PORT/v1/canvases/personal/ws?token=…`. A stock
`y-websocket` `WebsocketProvider(serverUrl = "wss://HOST:PORT/v1/canvases", room = "<id>/ws",
doc, { params: { token } })` works as-is (its socket must also send the instance header).

### Change notifications

Members get `event: canvas` on `GET /v1/sync/events`
(`{"type":"canvas","canvas_id":"…","kind":"…"}`) — refetch the list or the canvas:

| `kind` | Sent to | When |
|---|---|---|
| `created` | owner | canvas created |
| `renamed` | members | rename |
| `deleted` | former members | delete |
| `invited` | the invitee (if they have an account) | new invite, or a re-send reminder (at most every 30 s per invite) |
| `invite_revoked` | the invitee (if they have an account) | owner or inviter revoked a pending invite |
| `invite_declined` | the inviter | invite declined |
| `member_added` | members | invite accepted |
| `member_removed` | members + the removed user | member removed / left |
| `update` | members | document changed (at most once per 2 s per canvas, plus one trailing) |
| `mention` | each newly mentioned member | someone @mentioned you in the canvas chat (0.6.0) |
| `mention_read` | you | your mentions on that canvas were marked read (e.g. on another device) (0.6.0) |

## Rooms

One in-memory room per open canvas: a `yrs::Doc` behind a `tokio::sync::RwLock`, an
awareness table, and one `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel (256 frames) fanned out to peers.

- **Load**: decrypt the snapshot, then every update with `seq > snapshot.seq`, in order.
- **Write path** (WebSocket update, REST ops, rename): take the write lock → apply in one
  transaction → seal and `INSERT` the update the transaction produced → broadcast it to the
  other peers. The lock is held across the insert, so persisted order = applied order =
  broadcast order, and **nothing is broadcast before it is durable**. If the insert fails
  the in-memory document is discarded (reloaded from Postgres on next use) and all peers are
  disconnected (`1011`); y-websocket clients reconnect and their sync handshake re-sends
  whatever the server is missing, so no edit is lost.
- **Compaction**: every 200 persisted updates, `encode_state_as_update_v1` of the room doc is
  sealed into `canvas_snapshots` and the folded updates are deleted — one transaction.
- **Eviction**: a room with no peers and no REST use for 60 s is dropped from memory (it is
  only removed when nothing else holds it, so an in-flight write can never be orphaned).
- **Awareness** (cursors/presence) is relayed between peers and kept in memory only, never
  persisted. When a socket closes, the awareness states it published are removed and peers
  are told.
- **Backpressure**: each peer has a read loop and a write task. Replies go through a bounded
  per-peer queue (32); a peer that falls more than 256 broadcast frames behind, or does not
  accept a frame within 15 s, is disconnected (`1013`) and resyncs on reconnect. The server
  pings every 30 s and drops peers silent for 90 s.
- **Shutdown**: on the process shutdown signal every socket is closed with `1001`.

### Limits

| What | Limit |
|---|---|
| WebSocket message / frame | 8 MiB (the page stores images as `data:` URLs up to 2 MiB) |
| `POST /ops` body | 4 MiB; 500 ops per call |
| Other canvas request bodies | 64 KiB |
| Canvas name | 200 characters |
| Awareness clients per socket | 16 |
| Sticky/text body | 20 000 characters; titles/labels cut to 500 |
| Mentions | 100 `user_ids` per call; excerpt cut to 200 characters; `message_id` ≤ 128; 60 calls per minute per user; `GET /mentions` ≤ 100; `POST /mentions/read` ≤ 500 ids |

### Metrics

| Name | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `canvas_rooms` | gauge | rooms in memory |
| `canvas_peers` | gauge | connected WebSocket peers |
| `canvas_updates_persisted_total` | counter | Yjs updates written to `canvas_updates` |
| `canvas_update_bytes_total` | counter | plaintext bytes of those updates |
| `canvas_compactions_total` | counter | snapshot compactions |
| `canvas_ws_bytes_in_total` / `canvas_ws_bytes_out_total` | counter | WebSocket payload bytes |
| `canvas_mentions_total` | counter | chat mentions stored (new recipients notified) |
| `canvas_mentions_rate_limited_total` | counter | `POST /canvases/{id}/mentions` calls refused with `429` |

`copper_cloud_canvas::rooms_metrics()` returns the live `{rooms, peers}` counts.

## Web share-link landing page

`GET /join/{token}` is outside `/v1` and the instance-key gate. It returns a tiny self-contained
HTML page with an `Open this canvas in Copper` handoff when the request `Host` is a valid hostname
or IP with an optional port. It never looks up the token or includes canvas data. Invalid Host
headers receive a safe fallback message instead of a custom-scheme URL. The response is
`Cache-Control: no-store`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
and CSP `default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'`.

## Security model

- **Authentication** is the core session (`AuthUser`); the instance-key gate runs first.
- **Authorization** is membership, checked on every REST call and at WebSocket upgrade.
  Removing a member or deleting a canvas disconnects affected sockets immediately. (A session
  revoked by logout does not cut an already-open socket; it fails on reconnect.)
- **Encryption at rest**: each canvas has a random 32-byte `doc_key`, wrapped by the KEK
  derived from `master_key` (`canvases.doc_key_wrapped`). Every update and snapshot is
  AES-256-GCM `nonce(12) || ciphertext || tag` under that key with AAD = the canvas id's 16
  raw bytes, so rows copied to another canvas fail to decrypt. Key rotation is out of scope
  (see [security.md](security.md)). Chat lives in the document, so it is sealed the same way;
  mention excerpts are sealed under the same doc key with AAD
  `"copper-cloud/v1/mention:" ‖ the mention id's 16 raw bytes`. Mention ids, message ids,
  sender/recipient and timestamps are not encrypted.
- **Invite tokens**: a random secret is generated per invite but only its SHA-256 is stored
  (reserved for future shareable links); v1 is email-invite only and never returns it.
- **Logging**: canvas and user ids, op counts and error kinds only — never tokens, document
  contents, awareness state or update bytes.
- **Input**: y-protocol frames are decoded with `yrs`; undecodable frames or rejected updates
  close that socket (`1007`) without touching the room. Ops are validated like the page
  validates them (types, colours, URLs, sizes); bad ops are skipped and reported.

## Testing

`cargo test -p copper-cloud-canvas` runs unit tests plus integration tests against the
native Postgres database `copper_cloud_test_canvas` (`postgres://localhost:5432/…`, current
OS user; override with `COPPER_CLOUD_TEST_CANVAS_DATABASE_URL`): REST lifecycle, Personal
canvas, invites (re-send reminders, revocation), 404 scoping, two-client sync + awareness,
persistence across eviction, compaction, ops fan-out, revocation, the `chat` array across
eviction / restart / compaction (`tests/chat.rs`), and mentions — member filtering,
idempotency, read marking, events, sealing, rate limit (`tests/mentions.rs`).

A cross-implementation test drives the real page code (Yjs, `y-websocket`,
`Canvas/src/ops.ts`) with Bun and checks that the server's `/read` equals the page's
`readCanvas` on the same document:

```sh
COPPER_CANVAS_DIR=~/src/copper-canvasweb/Canvas \
  cargo test -p copper-cloud-canvas --test js_interop -- --ignored
```
