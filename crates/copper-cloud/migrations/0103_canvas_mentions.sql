-- Chat @mentions on shared canvases (copper-cloud 0.6.0; see docs/canvas.md).
--
-- The chat itself lives in the canvas document (a top-level Y.Array `chat`, persisted and
-- sealed like every other update). This table only records who was mentioned in which chat
-- message, so the server can notify them (a `canvas` event with kind `mention`) and Copper can
-- list unread mentions across canvases.
--
-- `message_id` is the client's chat message id (opaque). `excerpt_sealed` is the sender's
-- ≤ 200-character preview, AES-256-GCM sealed under the canvas doc key (AAD
-- "copper-cloud/v1/mention:" ‖ the row id's 16 raw bytes), so chat text never sits in the
-- database in plaintext. One row per (canvas, message, recipient): posting the same mention
-- again changes nothing. Rows go with the canvas or either user (cascade).
-- Additive only: existing rows and older clients are unaffected.
